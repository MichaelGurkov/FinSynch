This paper is related to both the financial cycles and financial integration strands of the literature. 

The literature on financial cycles defines the components of the financial cycle and attempts to study the interactions between business and financial cycles.
@Borio2014 stresses the role of the financial cycle in macroeconomics and suggests that the most parsimonious description of the financial cycle can be made in terms of credit and property prices. @Claessens2012 analyze the interaction between business and financial cycles. They show that recessions in the business cycle that are related to financial cycle contraction tend to be deeper and longer relative to other recessions. @Meller2017 study the synchronization of credit cycles. They look at 14 advanced countries in 1906 - 2008 years using cluster analysis and find that there are several clusters with different synchronization patterns. They also find positive synchronization of the business and credit cycle. Unfortunately, cluster analysis is unable to provide insight into the factors that affect the synchronization of credit cycles. I attempt to make some progress in this direction.

Financial integration is a phenomenon in which financial markets in neighboring, regional or global economies are closely linked together. The literature in this field discusses the benefits and dangers of financial integration (see @Kose2009 for survey and summary).  Potential benefits of financial integration include efficient capital allocation, better governance, higher investment and growth, and risk-sharing. At the same time, financial integration can also have adverse effects. A higher degree of financial integration can generate severe financial contagion in integrated economies. @Popov2012 study banking integration and identify a mechanism by which financial shocks propagate through cross-border linkages. The authors show that a negative shock to a parent (foreign) bank leads to a reduction in lending provided by its subsidiaries abroad. @Degryse2010 analyze the extent of contagion risk through banking linkages. They focus on the 1999 - 2006 period and ran a simulation based on cross-border bank linkages and bank equity. The authors conclude that contagion risk had increased during that period. They also find that contagion is more widespread in geographical proximity. @Avdjiev2019 study the factors that affect the lending behavior of global banksâ€™ subsidiaries throughout the world. The authors divide the influencing factors into two groups: "push" (global drivers) factors and "pull" factors such as macroeconomic conditions that measure the local cost of funding and the strength of the borrowers' balance sheets and the financial conditions of the global bank's subsidiaries. They find that the lending behavior of the subsidiaries is more closely related to local macroeconomic conditions and financial conditions than to those of their owner-specific counterparts, namely that the "pull" factors are more important relative to "push" factors. From a financial stability point of view, the "push" factors increase synchronization (the contagion or propagation effect) while the "pull" factors should reduce synchronization (absorption effect) due to idiosyncratic shocks. @Cerutti2015 analyze the composition and drivers of cross-border bank lending between 1995 and 2012, distinguishing between syndicated and non-syndicated loans. They find (among other results) that banking integration (cross-border credit) is closely related to the level of development and sophistication of the banking system, strength of balance sheets and regulation.
 
@Kalemli-Ozcan2013JF find that output cycle synchronization is negatively affected by financial integration. They suggest that banking integration magnifies productivity
shocks (to regions or countries), making output growth among integrated economies
diverge. I use their methodology to analyze financial cycles synchronization.
